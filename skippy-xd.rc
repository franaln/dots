#
# Notes:
#
# - keysym can be anything XStringToKeysym can handle
#   (like F11, KP_Enter or implementation specific keysyms)
#
# - colors can be anything XAllocNamedColor can handle
#   (like "black" or "#000000")
#
# - distance is a relative number, and is scaled according to the scale
#   factor applied to windows
#
# - fonts are Xft font descriptions
#
# - booleans are "true" or anything but "true" (-> false)
#
# - opacity is an integer in the range of 0-255
#
# - brighness is a floating point number (with 0.0 as neutral)
#
# - if the update frequency is a negative value, the mini-windows will only
#   be updated when they're explicitly rendered (like, when they gain or
#   lose focus).
#
# - the 'shadowText' option can be a color or 'none', in which case the
#   drop-shadow effect is disabled
#
